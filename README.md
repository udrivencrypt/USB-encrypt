# USB-encrypt
An easy-to-use gui for encryption of USB drives using Golang for GUI and LUKS for encryption. Users will be provided a list of connected USB drives and will have to select the one to be encrypted. Further they will have to add password. In case, the drive is already encrypted, users will be able to add new passwords (max 8) or delete passwords.
